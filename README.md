# Hostel Management System

This repository contains the source code for a Hostel Management System, developed to streamline the administration and management tasks within a hostel environment. The system is designed to handle various operations related to residents, rooms, and other essential hostel functions.

## Technologies Used

  * **Programming Language:** C\#
  * **Framework:** .NET Framework
  * **Architecture:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Features

While specific features were not detailed in the repository, a typical Hostel Management System built with this architecture would commonly include functionalities such as:

  * **Resident Management:** Add, edit, delete, and view resident details, including personal information, room assignments, and contact details.
  * **Room Management:** Manage room inventory, assign rooms to residents, track room availability, and view room status.
  * **Fee Management:** Record and track fees, payments, and outstanding balances for residents.
  * **Staff Management:** (Potentially) Manage staff information and roles within the system.
  * **Reporting:** Generate reports on residents, room occupancy, fee collection, and other relevant data.
  * **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure access to the system with different user roles (e.g., admin, staff).

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these general steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

      * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (e.g., Visual Studio 2019 or newer)
      * [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (compatible with the project's .NET Framework version)
      * A database system (e.g., SQL Server LocalDB, often included with Visual Studio, or a full SQL Server instance)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mirzasaikatahmmed/Hostel-Management-System.git
    cd Hostel-Management-System
    ```

3.  **Open in Visual Studio:**

      * Open the `Hostel Management System.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.

4.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**

      * Visual Studio should automatically prompt you to restore any missing NuGet packages. If not, right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages."

5.  **Database Setup:**

      * This project likely uses a database. You may need to:
          * Configure the database connection string in the `App.config` or `Web.config` file (depending on project type, likely `App.config` for a desktop application).
          * Create the necessary database and tables. This might involve running database migration commands or scripts if provided (check the project for a `Migrations` folder or similar).

6.  **Build the Project:**

      * In Visual Studio, go to `Build` \> `Build Solution` or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

7.  **Run the Application:**

      * After a successful build, you can run the application by pressing `F5` or clicking the "Start" button in Visual Studio.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can typically:

1.  Log in with appropriate credentials (if authentication is implemented).
2.  Navigate through the various modules (e.g., Residents, Rooms, Fees) using the application's interface.
3.  Perform operations such as adding new records, updating existing information, and viewing reports.
